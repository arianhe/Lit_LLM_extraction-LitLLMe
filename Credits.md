The Chair of Proteomics and Bioanalytics from the Technical University of Munich employed me for this small project in Freising, greater Munich area. 

In addition to their education and guidance I want to thank them for for the opportunity to work on a project this interesting. Special thanks are directed to my immediate supervisor who encouraged me along the way and whose insights and valuable input really boosted the progress of this project! Hopefully many more students will have the luck to encounter a supervisor as gentle and supportive.
